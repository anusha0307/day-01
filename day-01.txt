2.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Http1:
->It is older version
->It has a slow network connection
->The data can be sent only once by the sender then the reciver can send the data. 
->status bar were checked to know that they recived Or sended. 
->The data can be sent by the sender if the reciver requests. 


Http2:
->It is new version (to overcome from http1) 
->It has a much faster  network. 
->added Multiplexing:The data can be sent several times at a same from both sides. 
->The sender can send the at any time even though there is no request from the user reciver.




3.Object and  it's internal representation. 
Objects, in JavaScript, is  most important data-type. Objects are more complex. An object consists of primitive data types and reference data types. 

Objects in JavaScript are defined as 
Key:value
Here key may be a variables or functions. 
 
The property of an object is that a variable is attached to the object
Ex:objectName.propertyName
here the object name and property name are case sensitive. 
we can Create an Object in  2 ways:
1.By object literal
Ex:
Obj={property 1:value1, property 2:value2}
2.By creating instance of Object  (using new keyword) 
Ex:
Let objname=new object()
